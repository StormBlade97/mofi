# Match my Mood
### About project
Match my mood is my team's submission to **Hack Junction 2017** happened from 24th to 26th November, 2017 in Helsinki, Finland.

The project was built within 48 hours to complete in the hackathon track **Entertainment**. We aimed at Elisa's (one of the event challenge partner) **Make my day** challenge.

### My contribution
I am tasked as a Front-end developer and UI designer. I helped our principle designer with technical insight of feasible elements and implement those design into the application.
